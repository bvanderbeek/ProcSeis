Thoughts
+ Large changes in delay in nearby stations real?
-> Quality control measure?
+ Polarity flips are assumed to affect all channels. Is this a good assumption?
-> Should check this...
-> Polarity flips should be consistent across stations (not event-specific)
-> After initial picks, find all polarity flips (simple CCF with stack)
-> After finishing initial pick set, automate a reanalysis of polarity

IRON STATION
+ Always an outlier...why?
+ Sometimes predicted polarity reversal

EVT509
+ Nearly radially polarised? Difficult to pick.

EVT72
+ Shifted all initial/original arrival times by 10s
+ Set initial data.meanDelay = 10 just for this event

EVT697
+ Both S and sS picks made
+ I only re-picked S

Normally try to pick first main peak of waveform. These events I picked earlier.
EVT3
EVT26
EVT32
EVT37
EVT48
EVT50
EVT52
EVT53
EVT58
EVT61
EVT328 (later phase?)
EVT287 (just PZ channel early)
EVT523 (just final PZ channel early)
EVT160 (just final PZ channel early)
EVT891 (second MCC picked early)

Anomalous Phases
+ EVT328
-> May have picked sS

Reversed Polarity Stations
+ These should be re-investigated
+ If a station is found to have one polarity reversal, it should always be reversed?
+ Easily identify polarity reversals be aligning waveforms and computing CCF
